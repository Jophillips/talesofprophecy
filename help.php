<b>Training</b>
Training in tales of prophecy can be a very efficent way of leveling up when you are in the lower levels. Training is very basic you have the option of inputing any amount of stamina you have, to train in a confined area away from other battles your character pratices combat on many levels and gains experience depending on the level he or she is. The multiplier rate is (your characters level X 100).
<br><br>

<b>Currency</b>
The currency in tales of prophecy can be very complacated in the beginning to understand. The game has 5 different currencies: Gold, Silver,  Iron, Wood, and Gems. Gold, silver, wood, and iron all are contected to supply and demand so they can be affeted by inflation. You need silver, wood, and iron to buy weapons from the weapons dealer, and in order to get wood and iron you must pay in gold. Also depending on where you are in the game the dealer from that city may charge you more or less of one currency to purchase items around that city.
<br><br>
<b>Markets</b>
The markets can be different in every city depending on the stockpile of that faction for that item the cost could be higher. You may want to risk leaving your area for another if the stockpile is low.

<br><Br>
<b>Bank</b>
The Bank in Reichtum is the only bank in the game its only used as an exchange station now, but before the great revolution it was a thriving centre where citizens could deposit money and withdraw what they needed. People think that the bank helped control the economy and slow inflation if it could. Now the only way to keep your wealth stationary is to put them into gems. Plus gems can't be stolen from you after a battle where gold, and silver can.
