If you do not have a map of the region I'm sure a family member could lend or give you one at this time you cannot buy maps for it is illegal to sell them in neutral lands. There are many laws set on the neutrals from past wars. One of the best things to do when you are starting off is to join one of the two factions by clicking of the faction click and then gets a job in its capital city. To leave the city you can click location and then move in eight directions NorthWest,North,NorthEast,West,East,South,SouthWest,or Southeast. Acier is the capital of the Red faction that is located at (13,B), and Bauholz is the capital of the blue faction that is located at (13,J). You can find out where your going and how to get there by using your map.
